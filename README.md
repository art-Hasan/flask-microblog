# flask-microblog
A microblogging web application written in Python and Flask that I developed for purposes of leaning Flask microframework. This application is a clone of this https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog. 

### Running
To run the application in the development web server just execute ***./manage.py runserver*** with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
